                    This project is a part of a student design team that I am a part of. Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group competes annually in the Aerial Evolution 
                    of Canada's competition. This year the team has constructed an urban air mobility vehicle, a quadcopter, to compete and it needed the capability of carrying four passengers 
                    (represented as Barbie dolls) and multiple cargo items. This cabin is to contain both the passenger and cargo sections, in which I am a project 
                    manager to oversee and review designs.

                    I designed the skeleton of the cabin using SolidWorks and to be constructed out of carbon fiber plates and tubes with PEEK inserts 
                    to allow assembly. As a team we completed wet carbon fiber layups and had the plates cut on a water jet. Combining this design with the 
                    other team member's designs for seats, cargo compartments, and aerodynamic panels was part of my role as Project Manager. I am currently working 
                    on a mounting method that will allow the cabin to be taken off the drone with ease allowing for more ease of access to the centerblock on the 
                    drone as well as maintenence to the cabin.

                    The aerodynamic panels were designed by another member for this first iteration and currently are installed. I am working on designing the 
                    second iteration of panels and to supplement my design I am using Ansys Fluent to analyze different shapes for the panels. Adjusting the 
                    attack angle on the drone will allow me to look at the drag and lift of the drone.
